## About the App
Its a simple iOS App made using Swift and Storyboards in XCode. It uses the h [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch the data of Pokemons and display them. This app was made as an effort to learn about various concepts of iOS Development. Some of the core features I learnt during the development of this App were:

- Making API calls using inbuilt functions of Swift
- Parsing JSON Data
- Infinite Scrolling and separate sections with headers in [UITableView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableview)
- Use of [NavigationController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller) and [segues](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/UsingSegues.html)
